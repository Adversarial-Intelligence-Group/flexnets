## Generalized Lehmer Pooling
This project contains new types of pooling called Generalized Lehmer Pooling and Generalized Power Mean Pooling. Other Lehmer-based pooling types can be found in `flexnets/nn/pooling.py`.

## Generalized Soft Plus
Generalized Solft Plus is a universal trainable activation function. It can be found in `flexnets/nn/activation.py`.
